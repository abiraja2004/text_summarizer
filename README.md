The project uses Python wrappers on Stanford's Open IE from https://github.com/philipperemy/Stanford-OpenIE-Python and NLTK.

Running the code
  
  1) Change the variable "content1" to input file name in the nltk_tagger_rake.py 
  2) python nltk_tagger_rake.py -> gives keyphrases
  3) python proc.py -f sorter.txt -> gives relation between objects and subject(common to keyphrases)
